Summary:

The Ethereum Foundation's Solidity compiler ships with a model checker
since 2019.  The model checker and its capabilities are described in a
manuscript submitted to CAV 2022.  This artifact accompanies the
manuscript and is designed to allow the precise reproduction of the
results.  For the artifact, the software is distributed as a Docker
image.

Special requirements: none

Justification for reuseability:

The artifact and the software relevant to the contributions of the manuscript
are released under the MIT and GPL licenses which allow their reuse and
repurposing (to a certain extent).  As is typical for SMT-based technology,
exact reproducibility of results often requires the use of a specific version
of a tool.  Therefore we ship some libraries (in particular Eldarica) in a
version which was used during the experiment reported in the CAV paper.

Since the model checker is shipped as part of production software, the
system contained in the artifact can be easily applied to problems
beyond those studied in the paper.  The system is also available through
the official Solidity releases.
