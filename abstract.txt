The Ethereum Foundation's Solidity compiler ships with a model checker
since 2019.  The model checker and its capabilities are described in a
manuscript submitted to CAV 2022.  This artifact accompanies the
manuscript and is designed to allow the precise reproduction of the
results.  The software is distributed as a Docker image.

The artifact and the software relevant to the contributions of the
manuscript are released under the MIT license which allows their reuse
and repurposing.  As is typical for SMT-based technology, for exact
reproducibility of the results we ship some librarires (in particular
Eldarica) in a specific version that is not the most recent.  This
technicality should be considered a feature, not an indication of the
library being out-of-date.

Since the model checker is shipped as part of production software, the
system contained in the artifact can be easily applied to problems
beyond those studied in the paper.  It is also available through a
variety of distribution means (e.g, npm, and a web interface).
